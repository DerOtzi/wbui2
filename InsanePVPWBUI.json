This includes under meshing/building outside the world borders and exploits like building into a base. \n- No spamming, racism, sexism, homophobia, or advertising in chat.\n- Aggressive or 'toxic' behavior is not welcome.\n- If a streamer is on the server, do not stream sniping them. If valid proof is given from the streamer, this will result with punishment.\n- Respect all players and try to get along.\n\nBuilding:\n- No under meshing/building outside the world borders and building into a base.\n- Building in artifacts/drops caves is allowed.\n- Blocking or preventing access to obelisks will result in all tribe structures to be removed.\n- No random Turrets\n- If u got raided and rebuild somewhere else, remove your old Base or u risk a Structure Wipe.\n\nRaiding:\n- no 3rd party raiding/defending.\n- Only 2 unmounted soakers at a time.\n- Do not cage anyone for longer than 30 minutes.\n- Do not raid the same tribe over and over, forcing them to quit. Everyone deserves a chance. Doing this will end in punishment.\n- Remove fobs after raid. \n\nIf you're not sure if something is allowed, just ask. \nIf you see a player violate the rules, please provide evidence and make a ticket in the discussion #tickets on Discord. \nAdmins will not restore lost items or dinos and have the last word.</>",
